	<Mood.label>sanity</Mood.label>
	<Mood.description>Sanity represents stressed someone is and their current capacity for hanging on to what remains of their marbles. If sanity gets too low, through reading the comments section or being told Warcaskets don't work with yayo, the person may suffer a mental break. Depending on how low their mood is, someone who has a mental break just throw a little tantrum like hiding in their room for a day, or they might just break down completely and go kick a nuke.</Mood.description>
