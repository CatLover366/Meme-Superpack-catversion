	<ToughskinGland.label>grignrskin gland</ToughskinGland.label>
	<ToughskinGland.description>This bionic gland releases chemicals and nanomachines son that toughen the skin, making it almost as resistant to damage as the legendary Grignr himself. While it doesn't add as much protection as some other skin-hardening glands, the toughskin gland has the advantage of not noticeably altering the user's appearance.</ToughskinGland.description>

	<StoneskinGland.label>conk creet (baybee) skin gland</StoneskinGland.label>
	<StoneskinGland.description>This bionic gland releases chemical and nanomachines son that transform the user's skin into a built-in reactive layer of concrete. The whole epidermis thickens and hardens to resist burns, while jointed exterior conk creet plates form everywhere they can - including the head and face. While it's very difficult to physically hurt someone using this implant, the plates and hard skin significantly reduces the user's physical attractiveness.</StoneskinGland.description>

	<ArmorskinGland.label>bugsyskin gland</ArmorskinGland.label>
	<ArmorskinGland.description>This bionic gland releases chemicals and nanomachines son that toughen the skin and add flexible subdermal keratin plates at strategic points, emulating insects like the great Bugsy. This makes the user more resistant to damage across their whole body. Unfortunately, these changes make the skin appear leathery, with wrinkles across the whole body and face, which is generally considered ugly.</ArmorskinGland.description>

	<CircadianHalfCycler.label>Streamer brain helper</CircadianHalfCycler.label>
	<CircadianHalfCycler.description>A signal redirector which isolates half of the brain, allowing the other half to sleep while the user remains outwardly awake. By alternating brain halves, the user never needs to sleep meaning they can keep churning out content for the voracious masses. Unfortunately, two hemispheres are better than one - working with half a brain causes what is commonly called streamer brain where the user selectively loses the ability to read.</CircadianHalfCycler.description>
