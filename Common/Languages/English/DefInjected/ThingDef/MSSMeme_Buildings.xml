	<NutrientPasteDispenser.description>A machine that synthesizes edible gamer slop from organic feedstocks placed in adjacent hoppers. It consumes less ingredients and time than any other meal production method - but nobody likes eating gamer slop. Accepts raw food, but not rough plant matter like hay.</NutrientPasteDispenser.description>
