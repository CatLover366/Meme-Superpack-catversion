        <label>luck of the dwarves</label>
        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] is cursed with terrible luck. [PAWN_pronoun] takes far more damage than the average person should, seems to get ill all the time, and is just generally plagued with all kinds of misfortune. All of this, despite [PAWN_possessive] attempts to cope via stress-eating, obviously has [PAWN_nameDef] on a hair trigger at all times, ready to snap at whatever misfortune life throws at [PAWN_possessive]. At least they are a VERY fast worker in order to make the most of their assuredly short life.


Also Sam, I cannot believe you put your best crafter who also had half the HP of a regular pawn in a crappy warcasket.</description>

        <label>Icewolf's fortune</label>
        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] seems to be cursed with a doomed existence. [PAWN_pronoun] seems to nearly die from even the smallest paper cuts, and [PAWN_pronoun] always seems to fall victim to a variety of unfortunate events. It's honestly a miracle that [PAWN_pronoun] even managed to live as long as [PAWN_pronoun] has.</description>
